# Better Jonas Devices

Currently in the game, Jonas devices are cool-looking, very hard to create and almost utterly useless.
This mod attempts to make these machines a little bit more powerful, to compensate for the cumbersome crafting process.

### Base Return Teleporter

- No longer gets destroyed. Instead it teleports with you
- Requires temporal gear to recharge

### Rift Ward

- Actively destroys rifts in 64 blocks radius
- Restores temporal stability in 64 block radius
- Can be picked up without losing fuel
- Base-game rift supression field extended to 128 blocks

### Night Vision Mask

- Clear and well-lit view, with only a small cosmetic overlay to indicate that the mask is active. No more eye-burning green!
- Highlights animated entites in 64 blocks radius
